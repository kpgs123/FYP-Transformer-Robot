Project Title: Adaptive Navigation of Transformer Robot for Transporting Objects in a Dynamic Warehouse Environment

Description:
This project aims to develop an algorithm for autonomous navigation of a reconfigurable robot named Smorphi. Smorphi is capable of changing its shape while travelling, which makes it suitable for various tasks in different environments. The algorithm is designed to enable Smorphi to find its path from an overhead camera and navigate autonomously.

The project will be implemented using Python and Arduino framework. The algorithm will use computer vision techniques to extract relevant information from the overhead camera and then use this information to create a map of the environment. Based on this map, the algorithm will generate a path for Smorphi to follow, taking into account its shape and other constraints.

The code will be uploaded to a Github repository, where it will be open source and available for anyone to use and contribute to. The repository will include the following components:

Source code for the Smorphi navigation algorithm
Documentation on how to use the algorithm and how it works
Example datasets for testing and validation of the algorithm
Issue tracker for reporting bugs or suggesting improvements

Conclusion:
This project will enable Smorphi to navigate autonomously in various environments by using computer vision techniques to create a map of the environment and generating a path for Smorphi to follow. The algorithm will be open source and available for anyone to use and contribute to, which will enable further improvements and developments in the field of autonomous robotics.
