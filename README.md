When using an external battery to power the sensor, it is important to connect the ground of the battery to the ground of the microcontroller or single-board computer. This ensures that both devices are at the same reference level and helps to prevent any electrical interference or damage.

If you are connecting the sensor's output to a microcontroller or single-board computer that only outputs 3.3V, you should use a voltage divider or level shifter to lower the voltage of the sensor's output signal to 3.3V. This will help ensure that the signal is within the safe operating range of the microcontroller or single-board computer.
